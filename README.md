# LearnForge
LearnForge is an all in one solution for helping students in learning things. It is build on gamification concepts to make learning engaging and as fun as gaming. It is powered with generative ai learning solutions which provides support for the student to excel in his career.

## Problem Statement üéìüïπÔ∏è

Students often find it challenging to muster enthusiasm for education when they are more drawn to games and other activities that may jeopardize their academic pursuits. Despite their genuine desire to focus on studies, students sometimes struggle due to a lack of dopamine production in comparison to the excitement derived from gaming. This can lead them down a path of unhealthy habits, resulting in admonishment from parents, neighbors, and teachers, and in extreme cases, even facing violence.

Even thought some students overcome the above obstacle many do not get proper teaching support and enough resources to pursue their intrests.

## Solution Statement üöÄüß†

The root of the problem lies not solely in the students but also in the environment and conditions they navigate. Instead of condemning their inclinations, what if we could redirect the same dopamine surge towards education?
